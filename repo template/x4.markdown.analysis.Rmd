```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
read_chunk("4.markdown.analysis.R")
```

For this analysis we segmented code in the R script 4.markdown.analysis.R into code chunks and named them. In the Markdown file you can now call these chunks by their names.

## data inspection
Check the Iris data set
```{r one, echo = FALSE}
```


## analysis
Let's see of the sepal width differs among the species.
Show the coefficient table
```{r three, echo = TRUE}
```


## visualisation
Plot the sepal width vs height. Show all the code (echo = TRUE, the default)
```{r two, echo = TRUE}
```
